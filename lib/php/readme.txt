How to use
----------

See Moodle connector for example usage.

A typical connector will use the hawthorn.php library here in conjunction with
the standard client files provided (hawthorn.js, hawthorn.css). Some connectors
might use popup.html unmodified, but it's also possible that you might
need to provide a popup.php that adds extra functionality.
