Connectors may add changes to the styles here. Some changes, such as padding

method.

At this point additional JavaScript could be included or added inline, for
example which might provide subclasses of HawthornPopup with extra
functionality, or replace the existing functions with new ones.

For localisation requirements, set language strings in between creating
the popup object and calling init(). Defaults can also be altered at this
point.
