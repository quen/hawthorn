Code contributions
------------------

I would particularly appreciate contributions of the following nature:

* New connectors for additional third-party systems.

* Bugfixes.

If you want to make other contributions such as new core features, it would
be a good idea to contact me before coding them so that we can agree on a
specification. I might not want your feature in core code - so to avoid
disappointment, it's better to ask about it first. (Of course if you just
want to send me something you've coded in case it might be useful, you're
welcome. Just as long as you won't be disappointed if I don't included it!)
