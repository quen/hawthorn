<!-- This is an example config file for a multi-server installation. 
     Note that multi-server installations may increase capacity a bit 
     but are mainly recommended for resilience (i.e. if you have servers
     in two computer rooms and want the system to stay available when you
     turn off the power/network access to one room). You shouldn't have
     more than a handful of servers. 
     
     The .2 and .3 configuration files are not commented, but are similar. -->

     set these ones up to use different folders, even when testing on the same
     machine, but that isn't required. -->
