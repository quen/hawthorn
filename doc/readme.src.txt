This folder contains the Java source code of the Hawthorn project.


For reference only
------------------

This source code is not intended for building the Hawthorn project. It is
useful:

- If you are receiving an error message with line numbers, and want to track
  them down. This code is the exact code used to build the hawthorn.jar binary,
  so line numbers will match.

- If you don't like the included JSP library, or want to use Hawthorn from
  a Java servlet application that doesn't use JSP, so want to see the source
  code for the JSP tags.

- If you want to review how Hawthorn is implemented or check for security holes.


Making changes
--------------

If you want to make changes to your copy of Hawthorn, you should obtain the
full Hawthorn repository from the following URL:

http://github.com/quen/hawthorn/

This includes an Ant build script that correctly builds the full distribution.
Because it is distributed using the Git version control system, you can also
create patches of your code, should you want to submit it to the open-source
project - or you can pull future enhancements and bugfixes from the main
version, automatically merging them into your changed version.
